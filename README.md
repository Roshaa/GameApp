This is where i currently code on my free time.
The idea is to make something similar to [shakes and fidget](https://sfgame.net/)
As of today(02/04/2024) there are a lot of missing features: no migrations, no cache, a lot of security

If this turns out to be an entertaining game i will eventual add security to the code and try to host the game
